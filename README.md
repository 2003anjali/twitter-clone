Twitter Clone

Project Overview
The Twitter Clone is a frontend-only web application that replicates Twitterâ€™s core functionality, focusing on modern UI design and responsiveness. Built with React, Vite, CSS and Bootstrap, it features a feed of posts, navigation to pages like Explore, Notifications, Messages, Bookmarks, and Profile, and trending topic widgets, using static data from `dummyData.js`.

Key Features
- Post Feed: Browse a collection of posts from `dummyData.js`, displaying user details and engagement metrics like likes, retweets, and    comments. A User can also post a tweet.
- Sidebar Navigation: Navigate seamlessly to pages such as Home, Explore, Notifications, Messages, Bookmarks, and Profile using React Router.
- Trending Widgets: View trending topics and hashtags sourced from `dummyData.js`, displayed in a dedicated widget section.
- Responsive UI: A fully responsive layout built with Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Static Data Rendering: Leverage a single `dummyData.js` file for efficient content rendering of posts, trends, and user data without a backend.
